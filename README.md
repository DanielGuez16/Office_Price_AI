The features include factors such as location, builder reputation, surrounding infrastructure, and more, all normalized to a scale of 0 to 1.  

The project utilizes modeling techniques to predict missing prices based on a polynomial relationship between features and prices, with the polynomial order being less than 4. The goal is to help Charlie estimate costs accurately and efficiently.
